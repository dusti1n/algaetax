## Run algaetax

After activating the Conda environment and setting the configuration file, run algaetax to retrieve and standardize taxonomic data from multiple sources, ensuring consistent taxonomy and reproducible results.

### Start analysis  

#### Run the main script to start the algaetax workflow 

During this step, the tool reads the configuration file, loads the input data, and queries the selected databases (e.g., NCBI, PR2, AlgaeBase). It retrieves and standardizes the corresponding taxonomic information, then saves the results to the output directory. The process duration depends on dataset size and the number of databases used.

**Important:** Activate the **algaetax** Conda environment before running commands.

Run **algaetax** using the default `config.yaml` located in the root directory:

```bash
# Run algaetax using the default config.yaml in the root directory
python3 algaetax.py
```

You can also run algaetax with a custom configuration file:

```bash
# Run algaetax with a custom configuration file
python3 algaetax.py --configfile <path>/<config.yaml>
```

Example for a custom configuration file:

```bash
# Run algaetax with a specific configuration file
python3 algaetax.py --configfile config_presets/tax_config_ncbi_pr2_algb.yaml
```

### Outputfiles 

After the analysis is completed, **algaetax** automatically saves all generated files, logs, and backups in the directory defined under `output_dir` in your `config.yaml`. Each run creates a structured set of output files that document both the retrieved taxonomy data and the overall workflow execution.

| **Output type** | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Taxonomy tables | CSV files with standardized taxonomic data. |
| Reports | Summaries of matched taxa and query stats. |
| Unmatched taxa (`taxa_not_found.csv`) | List of taxa without database matches. |
| Backups | Copies of config, input data, and blacklist. |
| Log files | Records of all steps, timestamps, and warnings. |

<p><b>Table 2:</b> Overview of main output files generated by algaetax.</p>

These outputs ensure that every analysis performed with **algaetax** is transparent, traceable, and fully reproducible, providing a clear record of all processed data, database interactions, and workflow steps for reliable documentation and future reference.

## Troubleshooting

Running **algaetax** may occasionally lead to unexpected behavior or failed executions, especially during setup or database queries. Below is a list of common issues, their likely causes, and hints for troubleshooting. If issues persist, test **algaetax** with a small dataset to verify dependencies and database access before running large analyses.

### Common causes of workflow errors

- **Missing config file.** Ensure `config.yaml` exists and is valid.  
- **Wrong file paths.** Input and output paths must match the configuration.  
- **Empty or invalid input.** Check that the input list contains valid taxa.  
- **Database errors.** Network issues may block access to NCBI, PR2, or AlgaeBase.  
- **Unrecognized taxa.** See `taxa_not_found.csv` for unmatched entries.  
- **Conda issues.** Recreate the environment if dependencies fail.  
- **Permission denied.** Check read/write access to working directories. 

### Installation problems

- **Conda not found.** Verify Conda or Miniconda is installed and in your `PATH`.  
- **Env creation failed.** Remove old environments and recreate from YAML.  
- **Dependency conflicts.** Avoid mixing Conda with `pip` or `mamba` installs. 

### Runtime or output problems

- **Empty results.** Input taxa may be filtered or unmatched — check logs.  
- **Run interrupted.** Restart if the workflow stopped or network dropped.  
- **Wrong database setup.** Confirm databases in `config.yaml` are correct.  
- **Errors in logs.** Inspect `algaetax.log` for details on failed queries.
